* 1. Why Navigation matters
- As my notes will grow up in size, scrolling would become slow and messy.
- Org has powerful built-in navigation: jump, fold, search, agenda.
- Goal: reach any note within 5 secconds.

* 2. Folding and Cycling
- Use `TAB` to fold/unfold headings.
- Use `S-TAB` to cycle the visibility of the whole buffer.
  - Overview -> Top level only
  - Contents -> All headings
  - Show all -> Everything expanded

* 3. Outlining shortcuts
- `C-c C-n` -> Next heading
- `C-c C-p` -> Previous heading
- `C-c C-f` -> Next heading same level
- `C-c C-b` -> Previous heading same level
- `C-c C-u` -> Go up one level

* 4. Search & Links
- `C-s` -> Incremental search
- `C-c C-o` -> Open link at point (Enter also works)
- I can add *internal links*:
  =[[* 2. Folding and Cycling][Jump to point 2]]=
- Or file links:
  =[[file:stage-1-core.org::*Lists & Checkboxes][Stage 1 â€“ Core Org Mode]]=

* 5. Global Agenda View :ethics:absurdism:
- Use tags, TODOs, or scheduled items across multiple files.
- Example:
  - Tag passages: :ethics:absudrism:
  - Search agenda: `SPC n m` -> match by tag.

* 6. Jumping with Bookmarks
- `C-x r m` -> Set bookmark at point.
- `C-x r b` -> Jump to a bookmark.
- `C-x r l` -> list all bookmarks.
