- Learning is solely dependent on effort. The more effort is put into learning, the better it is remembered.
- Org gives structure: headings for chapters, lists for arguments, quotes, and even tags for themes.

* 2. File Naming
- Use clear, conscious and consistent names.
  - plato-republic.org
  - camus-stranger.org
  - dostoyevski-karamazov.org
- Keep everything in `/books` folder.
