* Organising notes as files
:properties:
:created: <2025-08-15>
:end:

** Univeristy Notes
- One file per course: e.g., =math101.org=, =data_science.org=
- Include all lectures, assignments, and summaries inside.
- Use clear data tags for lectures: =<2025-10-07 Tue>=

** Book Notes
- One file per book.
- Use headings for chapters.
- Use description lists for character summaries and themes.

** Master Index
- Master hub with links to all active files.
- Example:
  [[file:math101.org][Mathematics 101]]
  [[file:data_science.org][Data Science]]

* Heading & Hierarchy
** Levels
- Level 1 (* Heading) -> Major topic or lecture title.
- Level 2 (** Subheading) -> Subtopic or example.
- Level 3 (*** Sub-subheading) -> Detailed breakdown.

** Navigation
- TAB -> Fold & unfold current heading.
- S-TAB -> Cycle folding & unfolding all headings.
- M-RET -> New heading at the same level.
- M-S-RET -> New TODO heading.

** Example
*** Lecture 01: Limits <2025-10-07 Tue>
**** Definitions
***** Limit
A function's limit describes behavior near a point.

* Lists & Checkboxes
** Bullet Lists
- Start with =-=, =+=, =*=
- Use for unordered information.

** Ordered Lists
*** Numerical
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

*** Alphabeticsl
a. First step
b. Second step
c. Third step

Org has multiple ordered lists, you can swith them with selecting a list and press S-Arrow

** Description Lists
 Term :: Definition

** Checkboxes
- [ ] Task not done.
- [X] Task completed. (C-c-c)
- Use progress cookies in headings: [3/4] or [10%]

** Example
*** Study plan [1/3]
- [X] Read chapter
- [ ] Do exercises
- [ ] Review notes

* Text Formating
** Inline
- *bold* -> emphasis or theorem names.
- /italic/ -> emphasis or book titles.
- _underline_ -> highlight special cases.
- =code= -> code snipets or variable names.
- ~verbatim~ -> keep text literal.
- +strikethrough+ -> remove outdated info.

Also, to make it automised, you can use combination of =C-c C-x C-f= on selected words to turn them into any format.
** Example
*** Theorem (Intermediate Value Theorem)
If f is *continuous* on [a,b] and k is between f(a) and f(b),
then there exists c in [a,b] such that f(c) = k.

** Tabulance
To change multiple lines tabulance, select the lines and use =C-x TAB= and then use navigation keys to move the selected text.
